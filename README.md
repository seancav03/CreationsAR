## Download in the [Apple App Store!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/creationsar/id1510487024) 
### Note: Because I am not yet 18, my dad's name "Jim Cavalieri" is listed as the developer. I, Sean Cavalieri, was the sole developer of this application, and will create my own developer account when I turn 18.
Download the file CreationsAR_User_Guide.pdf for information and instructions. User guide has not been updated since spring 2020, so download instructions are outdated and more features have been added. To try to app, download it in the app store "CreationsAR". To see more information, go to the page on [my website](https://creations.ar/creationsar/).
